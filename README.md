This is a game of blackjack played in the terminal, programmed with Python using VSCode. I wrote this as an exercise while learning Python and how it differs from C++, as well as to build my portfolio.

There's still a lot I can improve on here, and I figure I'll do just that as I learn more about python and programming in general. Some of the code blocks definitely aren't as human-readable as I'd like them to be, for example. 

The same goes for the comments/documentation: it's pretty bad right now and that's an area I need to improve in.
